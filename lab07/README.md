Lab07 README.md

## Contributions / Personal Work Log
During lab7, I completed the following tasks:
* Created our lab7 SQL database file via phpmyadmin
* Created two tables (courses and students), and populated these tables with columns as specified in lab instructions
* Added address fields (street, city, state, and zip) to the existing students table using SQL commands
* Added section and year fields to the existing courses table using SQL commands
* Created a grades table according to the specifications in the lab instructions using SQL commands
* Added two lines of code at the top of the database file to create the lab7 database if it doesn't already exist (this makes importing `lab7.sql` into phpmyadmin quicker for my teammates)
