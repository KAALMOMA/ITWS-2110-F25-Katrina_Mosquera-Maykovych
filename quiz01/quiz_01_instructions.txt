### Part 1: Restaurant Food Menu Website Setup 

### Using what we have learned, you are to create a new site for a restaurant’s food menu, following the instructions given below. 

 

### Part 1 - Create the local structure 

 

### You will need to create a folder called “my-restaurant”. Inside this folder, create an HTML page named index.html 

### This page will be your food menu site's 'landing page'. 

 

### Your website should be served by a local host.  

??? Your website should be served at http://my-restaurant on your machine.  

### Make sure you structure your folders similarly to the following: 

 

### index.html 

### --data 

### --resources 

 |__ css 

 |__ js 

 |__ img 

 

 

### Part 2 - JSON data 

 	 	 								 

### You are to create a JSON file in your ‘data’ folder with the dishes in your hypothetical restaurant. 

### You will be marking a list of your four (4) favorite food dishes. Each entry must include the following information: 

### Name of the food dish 

### Description of the food item 

### Category of the dish (vegetarian, vegan, non-vegetarian) 

### Cuisine of the dish (Chinese, Italian, Mexican etc..) 

### Image of the food dish (image URL) 

### Ingredients in the dish 

### Price of the dish 

 

 

### Part 3 - HTML, CSS, and AJAX: 

 

### Create the index.html to represent the restaurant menu data you created. Think about the semantic correctness of the elements you're using, keeping in mind that your document might not always be rendered by a browser. 

 

### Upon serving the index.html file, you will read the data file using AJAX to display the food menu of your restaurant. Please use CSS to make your menu visually appealing. 

### At least, you should have the menu data displayed in a table. 

 

Summary 

### You are going to build a website for a restaurant. 

### You will create a JSON file with restaurant food items.
